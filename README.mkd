Themis
=======

A validation library for Clojure, born out of my experience trying to use
other validation libraries.

Overview
---------

 * Supported Clojure versions
   * Developed with `1.5.1` but should work down to `1.2`
 * Artifacts
  * Leiningen: `[ohpauleez/themis "0.1.0-beta1"]`
  * Maven: ```
<dependency>
  <groupId>ohpauleez</groupId>
  <artifactId>themis</artifactId>
  <version>0.1.0-beta1</version>
</dependency>
```

### Why another validation library?

1. The validation rule set should be expressed as data.
   Rule sets should be able to completely serialize to EDN.
2. Validators should always resolve to something that supports IFn.
   The resolution of data to IFn-ables happens at validation time.
3. Applying validation should be nothing more than applying functions
   and seq'ing the results together.
4. Validation is often domain specific, and the library should be open
   for modification to easily adapt to different requirements.
5. Validation results should not be conj'd/merge'd onto the original data
   (unless the user specifically did that).
6. Validation rule sets should allow for proper namespacing of
   validators (symbols/functions/etc) and general data.

### Assumptions and expectations

Themis attempts to make no assumptions about the data structure you're
validating, the results your validator functions return, or how
you want to package up the results of a full `validation`.

When assumptions are made, there is always an escape hatch allowing
you to modify the behavior to better suit your application needs.

### Why the name `Themis`?

I was originally using `metis`, a validation library named after Zeus'
first wife.  So, I naturally named mine after Zeus' second wife.
